# Data-Gridding-Exercise

Uploading above is the orginal dataset, different file types of my code, as well as my final map and presentation that I will use to explain my solution.

You will notice:
-Full Version Files
-Shortened Version Files

Full version is my working copy, with created images that follow my thought process and the images I used to check on my code as I was creating it.

Shortened version, is the minimum code needed to create my final map.

Please let me know if you have any questions!
